#Express
### what I found out
Express reminds me a lot of Sinatra. It is RESTful and simplistic.
It doesn't force any conventions on you and leaves things up to you as
far as MVC, for one it really doesn't have a controller, Express uses
Routes.

This is my documentation of Express and how to use it.

Use with 
  -    connect
  -    stylus
  -    ejs
  -    node

Markdown is really much nicer to work with if you use moo.

Moo spits out the markup in almost real time.

So you can see exactly what you get.

##Nice ! 

** Anyways we always going to use markdown when we can! **

	var express = require('express');
      
      var app = express();

      app.configure( function () {
        app.use(express.logger('dev'));
        app.use(express.favicon());
        app.use(express.static(_dirname + '/public'));
      });
    
      app.listen(3000);

And just like that we have beautiful code in our markdown file without 

any fuse, it's a snap to add code blocks and anything else you would do

with HTML except without all the ugliness and boilerplate.
