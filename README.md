#Express
### what I found out
I love Sinatra, lets just get that out there. When I first started
messing around with it, I took to it.

Now Express reminds me a lot of Sinatra. It is RESTful and simplistic.
It doesn't force any conventions on you, if you want that sort of thing
than use a framework like Rails or something of the like.

This is my documentation of Express and how to use it.
